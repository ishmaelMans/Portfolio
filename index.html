    It is not a good pratice put the same name in id and a class. You need choose
    one. I prefer using classes for everything, so in this case I would remove
    the id="navbar" and let just the class="navbar". I could see that you do
    this quite often, so look your code and try to identify thoses point that
    you can remove the id that has the same name of a class.

            Here in this class menu-btn_burger I think you tried to follow the

            think the correct way of doing this would be menu-btn__burger since
            the menu-btn will be the block of the content and the burger would be
            the element. If you are not understanding anything from what I am
            saying so I think you should read this document https://getbem.com/naming/
            I also sqw that you did that mistake in others places in your code
            so I think it would be nice if you try to change it or apply it in
            the right way once you build the react version of it.

        For better accessibility this element should be a <nav /> tag instead of

        Well done. Usually a page should have only one <nav /> tag and it should
        be followed by <ul /> or <ol /> and it should have <li /> children. So,
        you have just missed the <nav /> tag.

    Two things here:

    1) You don't need to comment your code when it is obvious that this is a new section.
    You did it very often in your code and that just represents that you need to
    split your html file into other files. You can't do it with pure HTML but you can
    do it with React so try to apply that in React like we discussed.

    2) Here I can that is another nav. For accessibility porpuses you can't have
    more then one nav in your website. So you should choose one and remove the
    other.

    I liked that you used main here, that is really good for SEO (Search Engine
    Optimization e.g. Google, Bing, DuckDuck Go search engines), but I can see
    that you didn't use <section /> tag even once. You show use more that for
    new section that you are build. With that your code will be more semantic.

      Two things here:

      1) Like here! This is a perfect usage for <section /> tag. You should use
      <section /> tag here.

      2) I saw that you put classes name like "section-A", "section-B", "section-C"
      and that is not good for your code. You should name it proprely. This section
      for example could be your name ishmael-mansary, the next one should be
      about-me and so one.

          for semantic, every page should have ONLY ONE <h1 /> tag and I saw that
          you have one <h1 /> tag for EACH section. That definitively is not good.
          The <h1 /> tag holds the most important text for that page. In this case
          I think this <h1 /> should be keeped and you should remove the other ones.
          As it is your portifolio, your name should be the most important information.

        Naming things is hard I know haha. That will be improved with the time
        but lets talk about this one "text-wrap". If I just looked for this class
        what I could know about this? Ok, this element is wrapping some text...
        Ok, like the <body /> tag is doing also. So, the point here is: This name
        is too vage! In programming we need to be very, very, very specific about
        the naming. We should be able to know the maximum that we can by just reading
        the name. I think this will be better if you put names like:
        suffix-texts-wrapper or typing-animation-texts-wrapper.
        Don't be afraid to put big names on it, since it describes better what it
        is.

      <div class="text-wrap">
        <!--
          This is also other important thing. Usually, simple texts should be

          that the React complains about this.

        <h3>MY STORY</h3>
        <p>Hi! I am Ishmael Mansaray, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web experiences. Designing and
          Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself into web
          design/development since 2019. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional
          websites.<br /><br>
          For over past 3 years, I have worked for some of the best digital agencies and wonderful clients to create
          some
          amazing works. And, I can make this happen for your business as well.<br><br>
          I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be
          taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting
          things that matter.
        </p>
